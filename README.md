# Simulation-of-PV-System

## Introduction

This is my course design of **Practical Course Power Electronics for Distributed Energy Systems (EI8031 in TUM)**. 

The simulation content is listed as follows:

Part 1 – [**Boost converter for PV applications**](Requirement\Project 1\project_part_1.pdf)

- PV string characterization
- Design of a boost converter
- Modulation and open loop operation of the boost converter
- Implementation of a Maximum Power Point Tracker



 Part 2 – **Grid Synchronization**

- Basic quadrature PLL (Phase Locked Loop) – principles
- Controller design
- Response to unbalanced voltages
- Response to harmonics
- Moving Average Filter PLL



 Part 3 – **Current and Power control of three-phase inverters**

- Three phase modulation
- Dq modelling
- Current control for L filter
- LCL filter design
- Current control for LCL filter
- Dc bus capacitor design
- Dc bus voltage control
- Droop control
- Instantaneous power measurement



 Part 4 – **System Integration **

- Integration of current control and synchronization
- Integration of the dc bus voltage control
- Integration of the boost converter
- Integration of the power control
- Tests under different grid conditions

## Pre-requirement

The simulation is based on the software [PLECS](https://www.plexim.com/download/standalone).
